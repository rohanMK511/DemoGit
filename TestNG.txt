*. TestNG : It is an Testing Framework designed to simplify the Unit testing to Integration Testing . TestNG provides you full control over the test cases and the execution of the test cases. Due to this reason, TestNG is also known as a testing framework.
   Syntax : @Test , @BeforeTest etc.

*. TestNG Groups : TestNG Groups allow you to perform groupings of different test methods. Grouping of test methods is required when you want to access the test methods of different classes.

*. Annotations : TestNG Annotation is a piece of code which is inserted inside a program or business logic used to control the flow of execution of test methods.
- @Test : eg - @Test(enabled = False) : 
- @BeforeSuite : Executed before all the test methods are executed.
- @AfterSuite : Executed after all the test methods are executed successfully.
- @BeforeClass
- @AfterClass
- @BeforeMethod
- @AfterMethod
- While writing the test cases in the TestNG, you need to mention the @Test annotation before the test method.
- Annotation Attributes : enabled , dependsOnMethods , Priority , 

*. TestNG Paramerter : 
- @Parameters({"a","b"}) : 

*. TestNG Listeners : TestNG provides the @Listeners annotation which listens to every event that occurs in a selenium code
- @Listeners
- onTestStart():
- onTestSuccess():
- onTestFailure():
- onTestSkipped():

*. TestNG Advantages :
- It generates the report in a proper format, which includes the following information:
Number of test cases executed.
Number of test cases passed.
Number of test cases failed.
Number of test cases skipped
- Multiple test cases can be grouped easily by converting them into a testng.xml file, in which you can set the priority of each test case that determines which test case should be executed first.
- With the help of TestNG, you can execute the multiple test cases on multiple browsers known as cross-browser testing.
- The TestNG framework can be easily integrated with other tools such as Maven. Jenkins, etc.
- Annotations used in a TestNG framework are easily understandable such as @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest.
- WebDriver does not generate the reports while TestNG generates the reports in a readable format.
